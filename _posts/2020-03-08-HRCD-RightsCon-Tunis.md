In June 2019, a group of practitioners gathered for a pre-conference event around human rights, usability, design and security. This event built on some previous convenings, conferences and meetups, and with this, we were excited to pilot a full day convening model alongside RightsCon 2019 in Tunis. This convening brought together designers, digital security trainers, tool developers, researchers, and human rights defenders from many parts of the world, including Tanzania, Kenya, Tunisia, Chile, Taiwan, UK, and the US. With a full day of discussions and workshops, we mapped out a set of challenges shared by the community members and optimal pathways to solutions as well as immediate next steps. We are so grateful to the participants who came and helped to co-create this first event and to set the tone for future convenings. 

Interested in human-centered design, and the challenges of building security and privacy tools for—and with—human rights defenders? Help us build and expand a growing community by fostering connections and collaborations around using, designing, and developing tools and platforms. We want to invite you to join the emergent Human Rights Centered Design Community. Read more about our recent convening at RightsCon in Tunis and reach out to hrcd@simplysecure.org if you are interested in learning more.

Our discussion covered a wide spectrum of topics including funding and resources, participatory inclusion, high stress environments, metrics and measuring success, and feedback loops between users and tool teams. 

#### Discussion Notes

* Funding and resources
  + The current landscape of tool funding has limited the formation and capacity of teams.
  + Compensation is not adequate or proportionate for everyone involved in the design process.
  + Abruptly pausing the maintenance of a tool—that is critical to the protection of privacy and security of a certain community—can be detrimental. However, it costs a tool team a lot to continue and expand their developments as funders are less likely to fund the maintenance. 
  + It is important to brew ideas and encourage the funding and supporting community. This would be to shift the current focus from funding shiny features and creation of new tools to regular maintenance, UX/UI improvements, or the prototyping and testing process.
